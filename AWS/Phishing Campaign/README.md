# Staging a Phishing Campaign

## Overview
Phishing Campaigns are when bad actors impersonate legitimate institutions as a way to get potential victims passwords and information so they can log on with that account. It is one of the most common attacks. I will be setting up an entire phishing simulator within AWS.

## Steps
I used the GoPhish Simulator
